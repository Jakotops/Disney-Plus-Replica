# Disney+ Web App (Frontend) replica made with React, Node-Js, CSS, Redux, Styled-components, HTML and JavaScript

This project is on hold as the firebase database is unaccessable to me at the moment

Any contributions to another firebases database I can use would be much appreciated so I can implement the backend to this app
