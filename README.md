# Disney+ Web App (Frontend) replica made with React, Node-Js, CSS, Redux, Styled-components, HTML and JavaScript

This project is on hold as the firebase database to acquire the movies is unaccessable.

Any contributions to another firebases database the app can use would be much appreciated so I can implement the backend to this app.
